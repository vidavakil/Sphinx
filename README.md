# Sphinx
SPHINX is a design verification tool for asynchronous circuits and systems which has the capability of verifying speed independence and conformance of asynchronous circuits to their specifications. The tool was developed at the USC Asynchronous CAD Group by Vida Vakilotojar as part of her Ph.D. dissertation under the guidance of Dr. Peter A. Beerel. 

SPHINX uses the Generic Utilities package of [VIS](http://www-cad.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vis/index.html), and in particular the CU Decision Diagram package.
